# Managing Assets

Building new sites includes three major steps

1.  Creating a new physical site

2.  Creating a new logical site

3.  Adding device into the logical site. Adding device supports two modes to
    meet the demands of different scenarios:

    -   Adding one by one

    -   Adding batch by batch

After the devices and sites are defined, the user can manage the assets.
